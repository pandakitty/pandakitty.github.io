# Project Deep Dive: RFM Customer Segmentation

### Objective
Categorize 10,000+ customers into actionable groups to optimize marketing spend.

### The RFM Framework
I developed a scoring system based on:
1. **Recency:** Days since last purchase.
2. **Frequency:** Total number of transactions.
3. **Monetary:** Total revenue generated.

### Segment Distribution
| Segment | Definition | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Champions** | High R, High F, High M | Reward/Loyalty Program |
| **At Risk** | Low R, High F, High M | Re-engagement Campaign |
| **Hibernating** | Low R, Low F, Low M | Minimal Spend / Automated Outreach |

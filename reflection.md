# Professional Reflection: The Transition to Data Science

### Bridging Healthcare Expertise and Analytics
My journey into Data Science is defined by a transition from high-stakes clinical data management to advanced predictive modeling. With five years of experience in Python and a background navigating complex Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems like Epic and Cerner, I have developed a "zero-discrepancy" mindset. In the NICU and orthopedic environments where I worked, data accuracy wasn't just a metric—it was a requirement for patient safety.

### Growth Through the Portfolio Milestone
Building this portfolio allowed me to synthesize my technical skills—such as LSTM neural networks and SQL database modeling—with my professional history. 
* **Technical Synthesis:** I applied anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) to financial fraud, realizing it requires the same "triage" logic I used when managing patient metrics.
* **Problem Solving:** Designing a 7-table retail database reinforced my understanding of relational data structures, moving from a user of medical databases to an architect of business analytics systems.

### Future Outlook
As I complete my dual degrees in Data Science and Business Analytics at Bellevue University, I am focused on leveraging machine learning to solve real-world problems. My goal is to apply the precision of healthcare data standards to the scalability of business intelligence, ensuring that every insight I generate is both technically sound and ethically grounded.

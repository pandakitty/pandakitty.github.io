# About Ashley Love
**Junior Data Scientist | Business Analytics Specialist**

### 🧬 The "Zero-Discrepancy" Philosophy
> "In the NICU, a decimal point in the wrong place isn't just a data error—it's a life-altering event. I bring this same 'zero-discrepancy' mindset to Business Analytics, ensuring every model I build is as precise as a clinical record."

### 🏥 Professional Journey
My path to Data Science is rooted in high-stakes healthcare environments. I have spent years navigating complex **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** systems like **Epic, Cerner, and NextGen**, where data accuracy is a matter of critical importance.

* **The Meticulous Edge:** Managing patient metrics for NICU infants taught me a "zero-discrepancy" approach to record-keeping.
* **Data Translation:** As a Medical Scribe, I specialized in translating unstructured physician notes into structured, codified clinical records—a skill directly analogous to data cleaning and wrangling in a business context.

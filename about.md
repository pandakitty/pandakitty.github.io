# About Ashley Love

I am a Junior Data Scientist and Business Analytics Specialist currently pursuing concurrent degrees at Bellevue University (Expected Graduation: 2026). I bridge the gap between complex data landscapes and actionable business insights.

### Professional Background
My journey into Data Science is rooted in high-stakes healthcare environments. I have years of experience navigating Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems like **Epic, Cerner, and NextGen**, where data accuracy is a matter of critical importance. 

* **The Meticulous Edge:** Managing patient metrics for NICU infants taught me a "zero-discrepancy" approach to record-keeping.
* **Data Translation:** As a Medical Scribe, I specialized in translating unstructured physician notes into structured, codified clinical records—a skill directly analogous to data cleaning and wrangling in a business context.

### Technical Proficiencies
* **Programming:** Python (5 years), SQL (3+ years), HTML/CSS.
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Microsoft Power BI (Conceptual), Advanced Excel.
* **Systems:** Expertise in relational databases and proprietary EHR/EMR systems.

### Education
* **B.S. in Data Science**, Bellevue University (In Progress)
* **B.S. in Business Analytics**, Bellevue University (In Progress)
* **Medical Assistant Certification**, Charter College

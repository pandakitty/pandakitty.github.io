# Project Deep Dive: Real Estate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### The Challenge
To move beyond simple averages and identify the true "price drivers" in a dataset with 80+ variables.

### Visualizing Correlations
I utilized **Seaborn** to create heatmaps and joint plots, focusing on features with a correlation coefficient ($r$) greater than 0.70.



### Key Findings
* **Primary Driver:** "Overall Quality" was the strongest predictor of price.
* **Data Integrity:** Handled missing values in 20+ columns, ensuring 100% data readiness for modeling.
